Description: Generate metrics from logfiles for Graphite and Ganglia
 Logster is a utility for reading log files and generating metrics in
 Graphite or Ganglia or Amazon CloudWatch. It is ideal for visualizing
 trends of events that are occurring in your application/system/error
 logs. For example, you might use logster to graph the number of
 occurrences of HTTP response code that appears in your web server
 logs.
 .
 Logster maintains a cursor, via logtail, on each log file that it
 reads so that each successive execution only inspects new log
 entries. In other words, a 1 minute crontab entry for logster would
 allow you to generate near real-time trends in Graphite or Ganglia or
 Amazon CloudWatch for anything you want to measure from your logs.
